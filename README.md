# scheduleing-algortihm-app
an application that I made for a School project with a group. It solves 3 different types of scheduling algorithms  for real time embedded systems and visualizes whether or not they are valid or not. 
There are some checks done in the scheduling definition but it was made under the assumption that the person has a small idea of what they are doing.
